            <p>Rachel redesigned my garden two years ago now and everyday I still wake up, look out and love it.   I had quite a specific idea about what I was looking to achieve and Rachel was very good at listening, taking on board my ideas and reinterpreting them into a cohesive garden design.  Rachel’s sourcing of hard material samples is extensive and she works with you to choose the right stone.  Having gone through this extensive process, for us, the right decision was to stick with what we all ready had.  Rachel successfully, along with her brilliant landscaper, moved pavers to create entertaining space in other parts of the garden.  When it comes to choosing plants Rachel has extensive knowledge and having listened to your colour and basic knowledge requests produces an extensive list of options for you to look at and choose from.   Unfortunately for us, our garden was being planted as COVID restrictions hit and things ground to a halt for two weeks.   Rachel was professional throughout this time.  She kept in contact with me, advised me on watering and caring for the plants and even popped over when she legally could.  Her landscapers came back as soon as they could and the project was finished without any more hiccups.   I would highly recommend Rachel, she is a down to earth designer who listens and understands and holds your hand throughout the whole process.   Too many garden designers feel they know best and find it difficult to listen to their client.    Rachel certainly is not one of these.</p>

            <p>Rachel transformed our small, drab and dated garden in Streatham Hill into a wonderful, delightful space that we can't spend enough time in. She interpreted our brief brilliantly, making some ingenious recommendations to make the design work for the space and our needs. The crew she recommended for the build were hard working, polite, conscientious and delivered exactly what we were looking for, despite some tricky access challenges (those nightmare spiral stairs!). Rachel even helped us find the best local gardener to help with ongoing maintenance. One year on, we're even more thrilled with our garden. I highly recommend Rachel Hartley. </p>

            <p>Sophie and I did not have any experience with Garden Design but we can wholeheartedly endorse the service Rachel provided. We did our research and quickly came to realise there were a number of different Garden Landscapers out there that could easily taken advantage of our naivety.

                Rachel’s calm and measured approach was exactly what we needed and was very transparent when its came to costs. The whole process was seamless and we were very happy with the results. Rachel planted our raised beds in the pouring rain because when she has a deadline… Rachel delivers!!</p>
